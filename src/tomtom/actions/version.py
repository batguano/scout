# This is an action module. Action modules need to have a function named
# "perform_action". It can import tomtom classes and any other packages to help
# in its task. An action should use tomtom to get or send information from or
# to Tomboy and use the standard input, output and error streams as its
# interface with the user.
#
# Actions are listed dynamically in tomtom's basic help message. Actions'
# descriptions are taken from the first line of the action module's docstring.
# Make sure to keep it short but precise, the entire line (two spaces for
# indentation, the action's name and its description) should fit in less than
# 80 characters.
#
# KeyboardInterrupt exceptions are handled by the main script. If an action is
# currently doing work on data that could impact its integrity if the process
# is stopped right away should handle this exception to finish work in a
# consistant state. The user should be warned right away that the application
# is trying to stop its work. After the state is safe, the action should raise
# the same exception again so that the application exits cleanly.

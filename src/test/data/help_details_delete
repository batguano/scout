Usage: app_name delete -h
       app_name delete [filter ...] [note_name ...]

Options:
{% include default_options_help %}
  --dry-run             Simulate the action. The notes that are selected for
                        deletion will be printed out to the screen but no note
                        will really be deleted.

  Filtering:
    Filter notes by different criteria.

    -b BOOK             Delete notes belonging to specified notebooks. It is a
                        shortcut to option "-t" to specify notebooks more
                        easily. For example, use "-b HGTTG" instead of "-t
                        system:notebook:HGTTG". Use this option once for each
                        desired book. By default, template notes are included
                        so that the entire book is deleted.
    -t TAG              Delete notes with specified tags. Use this option once
                        for each desired tag. This option selects raw tags and
                        could be useful for user-assigned tags.
    --spare-templates   Do not delete template notes that get caught with a
                        tag or book name.
    --all-notes         Delete all notes. Once this is done, there is no
                        turning back. To make sure that it is doing what you
                        want, you could use the --dry-run option first.
